#### Introduction:
Bouldering climbers often don’t have a good way to track their progress or stay connected with others who climb.
We created BouBou to make that easier. With BouBou, climbers can log every bouldering route they complete, keep track of their personal progress, and reflect on past sends over time. The app also has a feed where users can see what others are climbing and share their own updates with the community.

To help motivate and connect climbers, BouBou includes a leaderboard that shows overall participation. You can choose to view everyone’s progress or just compare with your friends. On top of that, you can add friends directly in the app and chat with them to plan your next climbing session together.
