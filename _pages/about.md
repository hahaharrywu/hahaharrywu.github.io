I’m a senior undergraduate student in Electrical and Computer Engineering at the University of Washington, working in the [Wearable Intelligence Lab](https://yyueluo.com/group.html) under the guidance of [Prof. Yiyue Luo](https://yyueluo.com/).

My research focuses on haptics, wearable systems, and human-computer interaction, with an emphasis on embedded sensing and user-centered design. I enjoy building integrated hardware-software platforms that enable novel forms of tactile interaction and physiological monitoring. Broadly, I'm interested in creating intelligent, compact, and expressive interfaces for next-generation interactive experiences.

I am currently seeking Ph.D., Master’s, and full-time opportunities starting in 2026.
